To begin the description I think it is important to talk about the suggested topic. Well, this proposal is quite challenging, because it's out of what I'm used to doing, but still, I really liked the idea, it was really cool to think about how I would do the logic so that this game made sense and people liked to play it , I find the idea quite fun and would like to continue following if I had the opportunity. As for the project itself, I believe that because I never made this style of game, I had some difficulties thinking about the concept, so I didn't use the time I had in the best way. However, I really liked the mechanics I managed to create for the NPCs, like the way they interact with the player and the world and their positive or negative reactions to the service. Another important point is that if I could continue with the project I would improve the game more to fit better with the requirements, I know I didn't do the best I can, and if I had more time I would make the system more dynamic. For this, it would implement a mechanic to make the store editable so that the player could customize and leave the store with his face, being able to change the color of the walls, floor, change the elements of place, in addition to being able to travel between the world to see the store of friends or other people and get inspired to want to evolve in the game, I would make a management in which you can hire employees, advertisements that would make more people go to the store, have clothes for animals, level system to unlock new products...
